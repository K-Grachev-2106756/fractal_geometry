# Iterated Function System (IFS) with Pygame

This project demonstrates the visualization of an Iterated Function System (IFS) using Pygame. IFS is a mathematical system that produces fractal patterns through the repeated application of a set of affine transformations.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pygame library
- Numpy library

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:K-Grachev-2106756/fractal_geometry.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd fractal_geometry
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To run the program, execute the following command:

```bash
python run.py
```

## Configuration
You can adjust the number of iterations and the coefficients of the affine transformations in the main.py file. Additionally, you can modify the initial parameters of the Pygame window, such as its size and position.

To visualize your own, change "coefficients" list:
